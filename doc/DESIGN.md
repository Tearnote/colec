# Colec - UX design notes

## Motivation

The need to track collections is universal. People want to track music they own to make it easier to manage their collection, keep a wishlist, or organize albums they want to sell. Others want to track all music they listened to, because they find themselves forgetting what they already checked out in the past. The same need arises for fans of videogames, movies, TV shows, or any number of more specialized or esoteric hobbies.

Countless applications and online services have popped up to answer this need, and many of them are enjoying high popularity and have thriving communities. However, they tend to be very rigid in their ways. Users who are not interested in rating the items they're collecting find themselves unable to disable the rating field, while users who want to describe the state of their physical items in great detail have to make do with a generic "Notes" field. Furthermore, people who want to track more than one kind of collection have to juggle multiple accounts on different websites, all with wildly different feature sets and UIs. This causes user frustration, which can be addressed by a generic, centralized and highly customizable service.

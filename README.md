# Colec: a collection tracker webapp

*Colec* is a single-page Django webapp that allows users to track any number of collections, of any kind - books, movies, videogames, you name it. It was originally made for [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)'s 4th submission project.

## Important notes

The documentation is split across two files:

-   [README.md](README.md) (this file): Overview of the app. Read this to get an idea of the premise of the app, technologies used and project conventions.
-   [DESIGN.md](doc/DESIGN.md): UX design notes crafting during early stages of development. The design process is described entirely, from the concept and market research, through information structuring to visual design principles and color palettes.
